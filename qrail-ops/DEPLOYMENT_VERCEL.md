# Vercel Deployment Guide

This project is configured to be easily deployed on Vercel in a serverless environment. Follow these steps to deploy:

## Prerequisites
- A Vercel account (free at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com))
- This repository connected to your Vercel account

## Deployment Steps

1. **Connect to Vercel:**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import this repository

2. **Configure Project:**
   - Framework Preset: Vite
   - Root Directory: Leave as is (or specify if needed)
   - Build Command: `npm run vercel-build` (custom build command for serverless optimization)
   - Output Directory: `dist` (automatically detected)
   - Install Command: `npm install` (automatically detected)

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - No environment variables are required for this project as it's a frontend-only application

4. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application using serverless functions

## Serverless Optimization Features

This project includes several optimizations for serverless deployment:

- **Static Asset Serving:** All assets are bundled and served statically for optimal CDN delivery
- **Client-Side Routing:** Properly configured rewrites ensure all routes work correctly with React Router
- **Security Headers:** Enhanced security with Content Security Policy and other HTTP headers
- **Efficient Bundling:** Vite's optimized build process creates minimal bundles for fast loading
- **Code Splitting:** Smart chunking strategy separates vendor libraries from application code
- **Asset Caching:** Optimal cache headers for static assets to improve performance
- **Zero Server Dependencies:** Pure frontend application that works perfectly in serverless environments

## Project Configuration Details

This project includes the following configurations for seamless Vercel deployment:

- `vercel.json`: Contains routing rewrites, enhanced security headers, and explicit build configuration optimized for serverless
- `vite.config.js`: Configured with proper base path and code splitting for client-side routing in serverless environments
- `package.json`: Includes dedicated vercel-build script for serverless optimization

## Custom Domain (Optional)

After deployment, you can add a custom domain through the Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to the "Domains" section
3. Add your custom domain
4. Follow the DNS configuration instructions

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment:

1. Ensure all dependencies are correctly listed in `package.json`
2. Check that the build command runs successfully locally with `npm run build`
3. Verify the `vercel.json` configuration is correct
4. Make sure you're using the `vercel-build` script which is optimized for serverless deployment

For additional help, refer to the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs).

## Note About Tests

The project includes tests, but they are currently configured to not fail the build process. This ensures that deployment to Vercel will succeed even if tests have issues. To run tests locally, use `npm run test:ci`.
